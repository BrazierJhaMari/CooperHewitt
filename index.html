<div class="stuff">Many players don’t feel comfortable with standard controllers, especially those with dexterity challenges. Controllers often assume everyone interacts the same way, but real players bring a wide range of abilities and play styles. This effort focuses on creating flexible, adaptive ways to play by drawing inspiration from the customized setups many people already use. The goal is to build a supportive space where players can shape their own configurations, share solutions, and learn from one another. By empowering individuals to play in ways that feel natural to them, we strengthen accessibility and expand who gets to participate. This approach helps make gaming more welcoming and enjoyable for communities across the United States.
